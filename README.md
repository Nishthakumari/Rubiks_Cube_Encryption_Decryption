# Rubiks_Cube_Encryption_Decryption

This undergraduate project focuses on implementing encryption and decryption techniques using the Rubik's Cube as a unique cryptographic tool. The project includes the following key components:

# Rubik's Cube Representation:
A program that represents the Rubik's Cube as a data structure in a programming language.

# Encryption Algorithm: An encryption algorithm that transforms plaintext messages into ciphertext using Rubik's Cube movements, rotations, and permutations based on a chosen encryption key or key generation process.

# Decryption Algorithm: A corresponding decryption algorithm that reverses the encryption process and transforms ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same Rubik's Cube operations and key.

# Security Analysis: An evaluation of the security of the encryption and decryption algorithms, including resistance to common cryptographic attacks such as brute force, frequency analysis, and chosen plaintext attacks.

# Performance Analysis: Measurement of the performance of the encryption and decryption algorithms in terms of computational complexity, time complexity, and memory usage, with possible optimizations for efficiency.
